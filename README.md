# RAG-Chatbot
This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot that leverages Pinecone for fast, scalable, and efficient vector similarity search. By integrating large language models (LLMs) with a custom knowledge base, the chatbot retrieves relevant context to generate accurate and context-aware responses.
